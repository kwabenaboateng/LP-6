## Introduction

In this project, an ML classifier with optimum performance was deployed into a FASTAPI architecture. This solutions provides an interesting solution when you want to keep your model architecture secret or make your model available to users who already have an API. By creating an API and deploying it, my model can receive request using the internet protocol as presented by the illustration below.

## Description

<!-- 
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) # 
-->

I made my own API, this allowing me to interact with a Machine Learning model, that is to say:
- Pass data through a request;
- Get the data in using the API;
- Apply the necessary processing;
- Submit the processed data to the ML model to make the predictions;
- Process the predictions obtained and return them as the API's response ot the input request.
