## Introduction

This project repository acts as a guide, on how to deploy a machine learning model into an API architecture. As the fields of data science and web development converge the demand for integrating analytical features into web applications has grown. This project also seeks to make a model architecture available to only users who have access to the API. 

By creating an API and deploying it, my model can receive request using the internet protocol as presented by the illustration below.

## Description
<!-- 
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) # 
-->

An API has been created to allow interaction with the ML model
For this project, FastAPI was used.

This will allow for the following:
- A request for data through the API.
- Receive data through the API.
- Enter and submit data entries to the ML for predictions
- Process the data entries and make predictions / results
- Return predictions / results through the API
